# TF2 Calculate Max Speed Detour

A one-off extension for Team Fortress 2 that allows plugins to override the result of getting a
player's max speed.

[DHooks with detours][] currently has issues with returning floating point values; otherwise
I'd be using that instead.

Only tested and verified against Linux.
